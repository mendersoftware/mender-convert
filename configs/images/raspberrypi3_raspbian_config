# Real life SD cards typically have less than they advertise. First off, they
# often use a base of 1000 instead of 1024, and even then they are often smaller
# than advertised. The number below is based on a conservative target of 3.9GB
# (that's mathematical GB, base 1000), converted to MiB, rounding down.

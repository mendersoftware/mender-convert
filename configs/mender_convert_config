# Compress generated disk image

# This is useful when you have large disk images, compressing them
# makes it easier to transfer them between e.g an build server and a local

# 'none' - No compression
# 'gzip' - Compress with gzip
# 'lzma' - Compress with xz (LZMA)

#
# Note that due to reserved space for the root user on the filesystem, "df" may
# report a significantly lower number than requested. A more accurate number can
# be fetched using for example "dumpe2fs" and looking for the "Free blocks"

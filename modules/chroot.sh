        # run. Between Ubuntu 22 and 24, the framework for how this is set up changed. Previously
        # the "binfmt-support" package and its associated `update-binfmts` tool was used. In Ubuntu
        # 24, this was replaced with `systemd-binfmt`. However, the binfmt-support package is still
        # available. The problem with `systemd-binfmt` is that it requires the "binfmt_misc"
        # filesystem to be mounted on `/proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc`. Normally this is provided by
        # systemd itself, but it is not running inside a container. The `update-binfmts` by itself
        # does not work anymore in Ubuntu 24, because the format of the binfmt config files has
        # changed, but it does mount/unmount the binfmt_misc filesystem when calling with
        # `--enable/--disable`, so we use that to be able to run systemd-binfmt after it. But this
        # might stop working if the "binfmt-support" package is later removed from the package
        # repos. Perhaps then the filesystem needs to be mounted manually.
